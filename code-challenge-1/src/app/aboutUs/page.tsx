              Founded in the heart of the Mushroom Kingdom, Mushroom Motorsports began as a small workshop, assembling karts for local racers. Over the years, weâ€™ve grown into a leading provider of custom racing karts, inspired by legendary racers such as Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Our journey has been filled with innovation, community involvement, and a passion for adventure. From humble beginnings to racing championships, we continue to push the limits of kart design and performance.
